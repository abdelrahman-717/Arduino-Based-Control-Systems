# ðŸ’¡ DC Motor Speed and Direction Control via Arduino and PWM

## ðŸ§  Overview
This project demonstrates how to control the **speed and direction of a DC motor** using an Arduino Uno, an **L293D motor driver**, and a potentiometer. The direction is toggled via a push-button, while speed is adjusted using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** based on analog input from a potentiometer. The full circuit was simulated using **Proteus 8.0**.

## ðŸ§° Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- L293D Motor Driver IC  
- DC Motor  
- Potentiometer (for speed control)  
- Push Button Switch (for direction control)  
- Resistors (2x 220Î©)  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires  
- External Power Supply (for the motor, e.g. 12V)

## âš¡ Circuit Configuration
| Component | Arduino Pin | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Potentiometer (RV1) | A0 | Analog input to control motor speed |
| Motor Direction 1 (IN1) | 13 | Controls motor direction (L293D IN1) |
| Motor Direction 2 (IN2) | 12 | Controls motor direction (L293D IN2) |
| Motor Enable (ENA) | 10 | PWM control for motor speed (L293D EN1) |
| Direction Switch | 0 (D0) | Toggles motor direction |
| Motor Output | L293D OUT1 & OUT2 | Connected to motor terminals |
| L293D Power | VS = Motor Voltage (e.g., 12V), VSS = 5V |

> ðŸ§  The L293D is used to drive the motor in both directions and handle higher current loads. The Arduino controls speed with PWM and direction via digital pins.

## ðŸ§ª Project Simulation (Proteus)
The complete circuit was designed and tested in **Proteus 8.0** before hardware implementation. Below is the screenshot of the simulated setup:

> ðŸ§ª *The simulation validated the motor behavior when adjusting the potentiometer and toggling the switch.*

## ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used
- **None** â€” All functions used are part of the **default Arduino core library**.
